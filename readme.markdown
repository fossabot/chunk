Chunk
=============
_by [Meredith Mandel](http://www.meredithmandel.com/)_

Chunk is an ultra-bold slab serif typeface that is reminiscent of old American Western woodcuts, broadsides, and newspaper headlines. Used mainly for display, the fat block lettering is unreserved yet refined for contemporary use. 

In 2014 an a new textured style was created by [Tyler Finck](http://www.tylerfinck.com) called Chunk Five Print. It contains the same glyphs as the original.
